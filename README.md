### Description

NOTE: You need to download DirectX Rotation Game (Part 2 of 2) CodeID is 51889. Remember to put all the graphic files in the folder < Graphics > under app dir.

This is the game, as far as I know, originally created by Diapraxas team. You can visit their website at http://www.diapraxas.net/rotation for more information. I downloaded their game, played it, and thought I'd try to create this game. It took me a week to implement the game. So comments and suggestions would be greatly appreciated. For any reason, if the background display is very bad, e-mail me. I've only included Background.jpg because *.bmp version is 3.00 MB and I couldn't upload it. See the screenshot for what the game looks like. Also remember to download Rotation Game Level Editor to create custom levels (CodeID is 51890).
